### Notes
I accidentally deleted an outlet and didn't fix the corresponding connection giving my app a runtime failure. This casued me to get stuck for quite awhile but reaching out on slack helped me solve the issue.

### Notes
I tried running the app on my own iphone but because I use an iphone 6 the iOS was too low to work. I then tried lowering the iOS of the project, but it caused issues and failed when trying to build.

I also initially had a hard time enabling auto layout but asked for some help and watched the tutorial which helped me figured it out.
Here it is running on an ipad and a different orientation:
